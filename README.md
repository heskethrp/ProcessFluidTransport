This is a second semester course in fluids taught at Rowan University
Instrutor: Robert P. Hesketh Hesketh@Rowan.edu

## Objectives
 - Given a description of a physical process, students will be able to construct and use a mathematical model to predict the performance of the process.
- Using several pump curves and a set of process specifications of required flowrate and pressure drop, select a pump that minimizes energy consumption for the given specifications.
- State the purpose of baffles in a mechanically agitated tank.
- Specify the operating conditions of an agitated tank to suspend particles of a given density and size.
- Calculate the minimum fluidization velocity given fluid and particle physical properties.
- Determine the pressure drop of a fluid flowing through a packed bed, given the diameter of the bed and particles and the length of the bed.
- List six flow regimes for horizontal gas-liquid pipeline flow.
- Derive a mathematical description of a process using shell balances given a brief statement of the physical geometry of the equipment, nature of the fluid (e.g. Newtonian) and direction of flow of the fluid.
- Solve chemical engineering problems using numerical methods that include POLYMATH, python and COMSOL.
- Define viscosity, shear stress, strain, and momentum.
- Write the constitutive equations for momentum for a Newtonian fluid and a power law fluid.
- Predict the resultant force on a nozzle given the given the physical dimensions and geometry of the equipment, nature of the fluid (e.g. Newtonian) and inlet velocity and pressure of the fluid.
- Derive the velocity profile for laminar flow of a Newtonian fluid in a pipe.
- Predict the average velocity of a vertical falling film given the properties of the fluid and the film thickness.
- Describe how the viscosity of a fluid can be determined using a cone and plate viscometer.
- Determine the velocity profile of a non-newtonian fluid through a complex geometry using advanced software tools given a statement of the properties of the fluid, inlet pressure, and physical dimensions of the equipment geometry.
-Predict the pressure drop in horizontal 2-phase fluid flow knowing the fluid properties, superficial velocity and pipe diameter
